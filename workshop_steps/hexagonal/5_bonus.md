# Bonus: New external system

Company is pushing for event-driven architecture and kafka is the tech of choice. We need to notify when a new
account is created with an event to the rest of the systems of the company.

This time there is no guidance, keep in mind what we have done so far, and try to implement it in a hexagonal way.

Note: This is not a change, this is a new feature, hence our domain business will be impacted.

Possible [solution](/workshop_steps/hexagonal/6_bonus_solution.md), but please try to do it by yourself first.
